## About

This tool was build as a side project in order to help everybody, on all plateform to have access to this kind of tool. I'm not a developper, but I have some knowledge. This is also my first application using Tauri and Rust so there's a lot of concept I didn't catch well and maybe also a lot of mistakes in my code.

## Status

For now the I'm listing all the bugs and improvement in the Issue of this repository, If you wan to help feel free to do so. As I've mentioned I'm not a dev, nor a Rust/tauri expert and all help is welcome.

## API KEY

You will need to login in to chat GPT developper console and create an API-KEY. You have 3 free months so you have pleny of time to use the tool

## LICENSE

This was made as an Open-Source project under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

## Contribute
